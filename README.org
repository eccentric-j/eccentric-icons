* Eccentric Icons

A collection of fun custom icons for applications.

** Questions

*** How do I use thesee icon?

- Browse the [[file:./icons][./icons]] directory to see what applications are
  supported.
- Pick a flavor of icon
- Download the appropriate format for your operating system

**** On OS X

- Download the =.icns= file from one of the available icon directories
- In another tab or window, open the directory containing the target application
- Right or option-click the =.app= file and select "Get Info"
- Drag the desired =.icns= file to the icon on the top-left of the "Get Info" window

#+begin_src bash
ICON="$HOME/.local/share/icons/doom.png"
DESKTOP_FILE=/usr/local/share/applications/emacs.desktop
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eccentric-j/doom-icon/master/icons/doom-emacs/cute-doom/doom.png -O "$ICON" &&
sudo --preserve-env=ICON,DESKTOP_FILE sed -i "s|Icon=.*|Icon=$ICON|" $DESKTOP_FILE
#+end_src


**** Windows

(Thanks to [[https://github.com/elken][@elken]])

- Download the =.ico= file from one of the available icon directories
- Keep the containing directory open
- Download [[http://angusj.com/resourcehacker/#download][Resource Hacker]]
- Save in a useful place

Repeat the below section for any related =*.exe= files.

***** Replace icon for exe

- Locate your emacs install directory (depends on if it has been installer with `choco` or the official installer)
- Open Resource Hacker
- Drag the exe into the window
- Left click on "Icon" on the left tree
- Right click -> Replace icon
- Locate the ICO file from before
- Replace
- Save

*** Want feedback?

Yes please! I love design-focused feedback. For example, "Can you change x so that y
because z?" is much more helpful to me than "x hurts my eyes".

*** Since you shared the sources would you be open to PRs with improvements?

Very yes!

*** Can I contribute icons to this project?
Definitely! Alternatives are welcome. Please note, there are some requirements:

- a source image png that is at a minimum 1024x1024 pixels in size
- create a =./icons/{app}/{flavor}/src= directory, consistently will help automate this
  later
- the app refers to a kabob-case application name, just needs to be human
  readable
- the flavor refers to a simple way to describe the icon like =3d= =cute=
  =abject=. This way we can have multiple alternatives per app.

Then I'll change this readme by adding a table mapping the icon path to the
author. We'll cross that bridge when we get there.

*** Could the png, .icns, and .ico be generated automatically from a gh action?

Yes! Working on some scripts to automate the process entirely. The plan is to
support PRs that just add the original src pngs, optionally specifing some size
overrides if different images should be used at smaller sizes, and then the
tooling will use that to generate all the desired formats. A rough draft of the
scripts exists but currently only supports a single image to iconset to icns.

*** What if I'm seeing an icon and I hate it. I even kinda hate you a little bit for even making it?

That's pretty brutal comrade. But if you feel that way, it is what it is.

*** Do you feel you're maybe overthinking this?

Yes! Yes I probably am.

** Development

Install node dependencies. The scripts are written in node-babashka
ClojureScript as that's my favorite language and runtime combo at the moment.

#+begin_src bash
npm install
#+end_src

Convert an image to an iconset:

#+begin_src bash
cd icons/kitty-terminal/3d
npm run resize ./src/kitty-icon.png kitty-terminal
#+end_src

Convert the iconset to an icns file:

#+begin_src bash
cd icons/kitty-terminal/3d
npm run resize ./kitty-terminal.iconset
#+end_src

Just keep in mind these scripts are subject to change soon to support size
overrides and more formats for more operating systems.
